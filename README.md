## TimeKeeper-4.0
```
TimeKeeper-4.0 is a work in progress. There are several changes which are planned from the previous version. Most notably, it will use a new technique
to control advancement of virtual time. Virtual time will be controlled based on the number of instructions executed by a dilated process. 

TimeKeeper-4.0 is currently under development phase and is expected to be completed by May 2018.
