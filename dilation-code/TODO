1. Alarm Test has a bug which needs to be fixed. The alarm mechanism is not working reliably under TimeKeeper. Need to look at the kernel/time/hrtimer.c file.

2. nmi counting was disabled in arc/x86/entry/entry64.S to make Socket-Test Pass. Need to figure out the root cause/design another mechanism to enable
   nmi counting. NMI counting may not be necessary because repeatability-test passes

2. There is some weird nvidid-384 module build error during compilation  which can be read in this file:
/var/lib/dkms/nvidia-384/384.111/build/make.log

The error states:

DKMS make.log for nvidia-384-384.111 for kernel 4.4.5-dilated (x86_64)
Thu Mar  8 16:38:44 CST 2018
Makefile:19: /Kbuild: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** No rule to make target '/Kbuild'.  Stop



3. There is also a forking problem which occurs during compilation. It causes fork() resource to be temporarily unavailable sometimes. 
Need to check if this is because of any of the kernel modifications. (FIXED)


4. Disable module verification during kernel compilation in the menu config state.

5. New bug which causes kernel panic after TimeKeeper module is unloaded
